# Verde OOP Recap

A small project focusing in on the four pillars of OOP and interfaces.

- The interface starter code is on the `main` branch.
- The interface completed code will be on `interfaces-notes` branch.
- The OOP starter code is on the `oop-recap-starter` branch
- The OOP completed code is on the `oop-recap-notes` branch

_Coach note : I borrowed & built on the small [js-classes-oop](https://github.com/nology-tech/js-classes-oop/) repo this is just for the OOP recap_
