# Verde OOP Recap

A small project focusing in on the four pillars of OOP.

- The starter code is on the `main` branch.

- The completed lesson notes are on the `lesson-notes` branch. 

_Coach note : I borrowed & built on the small [js-classes-oop](https://github.com/nology-tech/js-classes-oop/) repo_
